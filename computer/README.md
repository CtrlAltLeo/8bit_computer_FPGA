# 8 Bit "Breadboard" Computer (using an FPGA!)
Created by Leo Devick and John Colton

## About the project
This code is for **CSC 457 - Hardware Programming** and is directly inspired by the 8Bit computer project created by Ben Eater. 
We built the entire computer in the Spring of 2025, and
were asked to recreate the computer virtually using an FPGA board. Most of the elements can be simulated on the FPGA since the computer is built out of simple logic gates (which is marvelous, taught us how the early computers worked, and shows us how modern computers work on a smaller scale and time factor), however we did not elect to virtualize the clock for both the joy of building circuits and learning the 555 timer.
